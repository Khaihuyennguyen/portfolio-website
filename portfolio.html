                    As my goal is want to become a data scientist, I would like to create a project that models the data and visualize it.
                    The project must show the effectiveness of the layout as wells as the visual aspect. In general, the visualization must
                    be interesting, dynamic, relevant, and well-received by diverse audiences. The most important is that it must tell a
                    story.

                Build clone websites including but not limited to Netflix, Apple, and Starbucks. These websites are good practices for
                beginners like me.
                While building the website, it could help me learn the fundamentals of page structures, colors, layout, fonts, and basic
                features in CSS, Js, and HTML.
                However, see these as beginner's projects as the website I created must be unique.

                These projects will be built in Kotlin programming for Android development. These projects would be a basic to-do app
                and an Instagram app clone.
                In the basic to-do app, it would provide daily tasks check such as reminder, delete, create, some basic text and fonts.
                On the other hand, it can connect to the calendar for convenience.
                In the Instagram app clone, it would function like a real Instagram app such as upload pictures and videos into apps,
                the users can add friends and chat in the app like the real one.

                "Friends and The Office: which show is better.?" Have you ever joined any internet comments section to protect your
                favorite show. If you are lucky, you can have thousands of likes and comments that support your opinion, and you know
                that the majority is on your side. However, usually, our comments will sink into another comment and we always wonder:
                which show has the most comments. Instead of search the keyword, this project will use some data scraping, API usage,
                Python, data visualization to do that for you.
